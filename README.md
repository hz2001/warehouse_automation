# DS519Ass4

This branch is for azure web app deployment. By wrapping an Express app around the React app build folder, I am able to sucessfully deploy the app onto Azure Web App.

The CD/CI workflow is specified in the workflow folder, and the app only redeploy when the information in the ./expressApp folder changes.
